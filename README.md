This is a fork of [ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips).

### This repo **only** provides syntax highlighting for snipmate and ultisnips snippet files.
If you want syntax highlighting, but use a different snippet provider like [coc-snippets](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-snippets), this is the plugin for you.
